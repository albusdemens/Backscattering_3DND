# Backscattering_3DND
 
In this folder you can find the Python script developed to analyse tha datasets collected at ICON, PSI, in backscattering Laue mode.
The final aim was to reconstruct in 3D the shape and orientation of the grains composing a polycrystalline sample. Algorithms developed under the supervision of Dr. SÃ¸ren Schmidt, DTU Physics, ssch@fysik.dtu.dk.

In the current version, the code segments the diffraction spots from the collected images. To do:
- Find equation of the curves defined by the centre of mass of the diffraction spots;
- Reconstruct the grain shapes;
- Calculate the orientation of the grains.
